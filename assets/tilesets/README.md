This folder contains the basic tile set definitions in the form of PyxelEdit 
files and PNG files exported from them.  Each file contains 40x40 images, 
tiled together.

To edit a tile set:

- Edit the .pyxel file, e.g., Items.pyxel
- Export the content as a .png, e.g., Items.png
- Copy the .png file to the relevant resources folder, e.g., assets/tilesets/
