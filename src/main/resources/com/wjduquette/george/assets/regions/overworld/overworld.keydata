%string sign.map.sprite feature.sign
%block sign.map.text
The sign shows a detailed map of the world, with an
arrow labeled "You are Here".  Unfortunately, you can't
read the language the map legend is written in, so the
information is of no use to you.

You might find it more useful to click the map icon down
on the control bar.

"Good morning.  You must left-click to moveâ€”but I see you've figured
that out.  And you may right-click to interact with things.  For
example, you can right-click on that sign there to see what it says."

He scratches his head.

"You'll probably need to move next to it first, though."
