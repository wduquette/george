# Signs

%string sign.map.sprite feature.sign
%block sign.map.text
The sign shows a detailed map of the world, with an
arrow labeled "You are Here".  Unfortunately, you can't
read the language the map legend is written in, so the
information is of no use to you.

You might find it more useful to click the map icon down
on the control bar.

# Joe Pro the Tutor

%block tutor.description
He's lean, but not mean.
%end
%block tutor.start
A man in black speaks to you as you approach.

"There are things you need to know, and I guess I'm the one
to tell you.  First thing is, you have to left-click to move—
but I guess you already know that."
%end

%block tutor.leftclick
"Left-click?" you say. "What's that supposed to mean?"

"I know," he says, "It makes no darn sense to me either.
They gave me a script, and that's what it says.  A man's
gotta do what a man's gotta do, and you gotta left-click.

"And if you want to interact with something—or someone—
you gotta right-click."
%end

%block tutor.interact
"Interact?" you say. "That's an odd sort of word."

"Yeah, like if you want to read a sign or open a door.
Right-click on it, and you'll be right.  I wouldn't
put you on the bus to Abilene. You can right-click on
one of these here signs if you don't believe me."

He scratches his chin.

"You'll probably need to move next to it first, though."
%end

%block tutor.final
"Is there anything else?" you say.

"No, that about wraps it up.  You might head on into
town, talk to the locals, if you're minded to have
an adventure or two."

He nods a goodbye.

"You'll see me around, here and there."
