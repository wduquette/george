# To Do

My current To Do list.

- Write a basic `RegionMap` class that can load a region in such a way that it can be rendered.  Don't worry about object groups.
- Allow George to be moved about the region in some way, taking terrain type into account.
- Add some objects, e.g., signs and other triggers.
- Verify that I can actually load current Tiled `.json` output.
