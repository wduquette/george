# To Do

My current To Do list.

- [x] Structure the app in terms of systems.
- [x] Move the mobile smoothly across the map, rather than jumping. 
- [x] Include a row/col offset in `Cell`
- [x] Revise map view to draw based on the visual cell: the row and col + offsets.
- [x] Define `Loc` component, combining a `Cell` with an offset.
- [x] Make all components implement Component interface, and only allow components in the Entity's map.
- [ ] Decide whether to retain basic movement animation
	- And if so, at what speed.
- [ ] Trigger signs as a blocking popup...drawn on the map until the user clicks.
- [ ] Render log messages on the map as a heads up display. (?)
- [ ] Render quest status on the map as a heads-up display
- [ ] Remove cursor key code.
- [ ] Script to copy asset files to `resources`
- [ ] Implement Old George's Line-of-Sight algorithm generically.
- [ ] Ponder how to structure the game state for saving.
	- Could use GSon, so long as I'm using it anyway.
	- GSon plus Base64?
