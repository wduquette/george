- [ ] Support moving to another region, e.g., Floobham, Bugland
- [ ] Implement movement limits (the player can only move so far)
- [ ] Implement Mover list
	- Probably a `Mover` sealed type.  
	- `Mover.Leader(playerId)`
	- `Mover.Monsters()` (if all monsters move at the same time)

- [ ] Render quest status on the map as a heads-up display
- [ ] Script to copy asset files to `resources`
