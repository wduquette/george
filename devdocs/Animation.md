# Animation
#component 

An animation is a component that knows how to update [[Sprite|Sprites]] over time.

- An animation can animate multiple sprites.
- The implementation is unclear, but we know the following:
	- It must contain the data needed by the Animation system to update the sprites.
	- It can be marked as `Running` or `Stopped`.
