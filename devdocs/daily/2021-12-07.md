- Got a slide animation working, but it's ugly.
	- The animation adjusts the tile's offset, which needs (eventually) to be cleared.
		- I do that in Step.SetCell, but that's kind of tacky.  Why should they be so intertwined?
		- And the code to create the animation steps under Step.MoveTo is ugly.
		- **Q:** should the tile offset be part of the Tile component?
	- The map viewer is centered on the **cell** the player character is in; but the player character's cell doesn't change as the tile slides.  It makes it very jerky.
